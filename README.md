## Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment

#### For Windows

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd path\to\allauth
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

#### For Linux

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/allauth
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have `requirements.txt` in the project directory, then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Database

1. Run the following command to apply migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Create a superuser to access the Django admin:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your superuser account.

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Step 5: Access the Admin Panel

Visit the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in using the superuser credentials you created.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have a valid database setup if you plan to use a production environment.
- You can customize the project further by modifying the settings in `settings.py`.
